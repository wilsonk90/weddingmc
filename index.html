				<p>Masters of Ceremony, Norman Saad was indeed the master of our ceremony! Norman did an amazing job listening to what we wanted and then successfully implementing our vision on our wedding day. All events ran smoothly, from the bridal party introductions, speeches, to getting the dance floor started and continuing on throughout the night! Norman knew exactly what to stay and when to say it. Everyone was dancing and having a blast! Thank you for doing such a great job at being our MC and coordinating the events of our wedding day, you truly made our day a day to remember!!!</p>

				<p class="testimonial">Norm made a terrific Master of Ceremonies at our wedding.</b>
				His preparation for the event was meticulous.  He was generous with his time and ideas in planning the event. He listened and understood our needs and he met in advance with all the key people involved in the celebration.</b>
				On the day, his warmth and good humour made all our guests feel welcome. Everyone liked him, including the venue staff. As we had the reception room booked for a limited time, we appreciated his skill and tact in making our celebration run smoothly and to plan, without feeling hurried.</b>
				We feel very lucky to have had Norm as our wedding MC.</p>

				<p class="testimonial">My wife and I found Norman to be professional and extremely well organised. Norman even went so far as to liaise with the wedding coordinator to ensure he knew what to say and when. </b>
				Whilst being so professional Norman also has the ability to bring humour to his work which made him stand out from the rest. </b>
				We highly recommend Norman and would use him again for any MC gigs we have.</p>

				<p class="testimonial">Thank you Norman for such an amazing night! You were charming, funny, yet so professional our guests had a great time and our reception ran smoothly. We didn't have to worry about a thing, except enjoy our night! We couldn't have asked for more. We loved how you took the time to get to know us individually to personalise our night and make it extra special! Many thanks - you will always be in our hearts.</p>
